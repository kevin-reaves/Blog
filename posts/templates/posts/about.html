    <h1>About Kevin</h1>
    <br/><br/><br/>



    <p>My name is Kevin Reaves. I graduated with my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science
    from Troy University in May 2016. I'm currently working as a Configuration Management Specialist for CGI's PSMAG project.
    PSMAG provides twenty-four hour support for the Advantage application. Advantage is a financial and hrm application that is 
    marketed towards state and local governments. </p>

    <br/>

    <p>In addition to my experience with CGI, I've also worked on a variety of personal programming projects.

    <br/><br/>

    a jQuery calculator, a sliding box puzzle solver, and a few other projects.
