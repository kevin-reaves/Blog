Hello everyone, 

My name is Kevin and this is my Django blog. Once completed, this will be a simple blog where users can create an account, log into the blog, and create posts.

The main functionality of the site is now complete. I will begin to use javascript/css/etc to make ths site more user friendly. I will also focus my attention on bug fixes and cleaning up existing code.

Added logout button, moved login/logout/home buttons to navbar.
Added bootstrap, renamed images on upload

The website is now live on http://kreaves.pythonanywhere.com/

After a bit of trouble with getting gitignore to work, the updated secret key is no longer visible.
The database and image cache will reset every night, mostly to avoid space/inappropriate content issues.

Fixed error when leaving sign up fields empty
